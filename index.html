                    <p>I have lived in several countries growing up and have met lots of interesting people. I love discovering new hobbies and front-end development has been a great find. I studies programming at university and have experience with JAVA, C++, C and I am learning about Python at the moment, however, I enjoy web development the most. </p>
                    <p>I used to teach and have a very creative mindset. I have had a painting in the Smithsonian Museum and I love looking for new ways to use my artistic skills. In my spare time I will always be working on a new art project. </p>
                    <p>I live on a farm and my surroundings and the animals that live here as my inspiration. My cat, Kirby, is my editor and boss so his approval is everything to me.</p>
